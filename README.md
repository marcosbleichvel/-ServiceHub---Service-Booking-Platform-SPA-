# ServiceHub - Service Booking Platform (SPA)

ServiceHub is a fully functional **Single-Page Application (SPA)** concept designed for finding and booking local home services like cleaning and babysitting. This project showcases an end-to-end user flow, from initial service selection to final payment, built from the ground up with **vanilla JavaScript**.

### Key Features

* **Single-Page Application (SPA) Architecture:** Instant view rendering (Home, Search, Profile, Checkout) handled entirely by JavaScript for a smooth, app-like user journey.
* **Interactive Booking Widget:** Allows users to select a service, adjust the duration, and see the estimated price update in real-time.
* **Dynamic Professional Search & Filtering:** Search results are dynamically generated and filtered based on the user's service selection.
* **Complete Checkout Flow:** Simulates the entire booking process, guiding the user from selecting a professional's profile to completing a payment form.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** A semantic structure organizing the application's different views and components.
* **CSS3:** A modern, fully responsive layout built with Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Variables for a clean and maintainable theme.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Powers the entire application's logic, including:
    * State management (tracking user selections).
    * Dynamic DOM manipulation to render all content.
    * Client-side routing to navigate between views.
    * Advanced event handling for all interactive elements.
